#include "Blocks.h"
/*
blocks.h과 소스파일은 테트리스의 7가지 블록에 대해서 회전할 수 있는 4가지 경우를 4차우너 배열로 표현했다
Blocks 배열
	- 첫번째 index[BlockType]에 따라서 블록의 형태를 지정할 수 있다
	- 두번째 index[BlockRotate]에 따라서 블록이 회전할 수 있는 4가지 형태를 지정할 수 있다
	- 세번째 , 네번째 인덱스(4*4)형태를 출력하면 원하는 블록의 형태를 얻을 수 있다
	
	숫자 0은 공백 
	숫자 2는 도형을 나타낸다
		-> 이때 블록의 표현을 숫자 2로 한 이유는 테트리스 보드가 표현되는 부분이 숫자 1로 정해서, 
			이 둘을 쉽게 구분하기 위해서 숫자 2로 정의했다
